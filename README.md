In this project,i worked with a real-world dataset from a telecom company that includes customer information, such as demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned (i.e., left the company) or not. The goal was to prepare the data for analysis, explore key patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn.
